      "comment": "I bought this skillet a little while ago and I was surprised how rough the surface finish was. It felt like sandpaper. Given all the positive reviews, I was expecting higher quality. After some research I found instructional videos on how to grind these Lodge skillets smooth, but who has time for that? I found two other American producers of cast iron that come with a smooth finish right out of the box: Stargazer and Finex. The Finex looks interesting but I went with the Stargazer because it's fully machined at half the price. Seems like I made the right call. The design is great, the surface finish is super smooth, and it cooks like a champ. If you're reading this review, do yourself a favor and pass on the Lodge. Go with the Stargazer instead. It's well worth the investment.",
